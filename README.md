This project provides an in-depth analysis of global population trends from 1960 to 2023 using Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries. It aims to create compelling visualizations that highlight changes in population distribution over time, with a focus on both categorical and continuous variables.
Key objectives include:

Analyzing population data for countries worldwide across multiple decades.
Visualizing the distribution of population sizes for selected years using histograms.
Comparing population distributions across continents or regions with bar charts.
Identifying trends, such as population growth or decline in specific countries or regions.
Demonstrating the use of Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data preprocessing and visualization.
